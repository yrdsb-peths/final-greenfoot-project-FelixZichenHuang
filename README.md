# Final Greenfoot Project
This is the README.md file.

My project is named as "Top Gun: Gaming" and it's a game about air war. In order to play this game, the player needs to install the Greenfoot software from its official website. After that, the player can run the project.greenfoot file and enter the program. Before the game, the player needs to right click on the TitleScreen tab and select the "new TitleScreen()" option to create the title screen of the game. The player can familiarize himself/herself to the game by following the instructions provided by the title screen. If they want to start playing the game, they can follow the instructions on the title screen to enter the main world of the game.

The main world of the game includes a display system. The player can see his/her score, the current level, and the number of missiles left in the player's jet.

Everytime when the player shoot down one enemy jet, his/her score will increase by one. There will be five spare missiles provided to the player's jet in each level so that they can shoot down the enemy missiles headed towards his/her jet if the time does not allow his/her jet to dodge the enemy missiles. However, shooting down the enemy missiles won't increase the player's score. The game has ten levels, and the requirements for passing each level will be given in the NewLevelIntroScreen. Only through passing all the ten levels can the player win the game.

Even though the player can cheat and directly access the GameWonScreen by right clicking the GameWonScreen tab and select the "new GameWonScreen()" option, it's meaningless to do so because he/her will lose the chance to enjoy the fun and challenging game.
